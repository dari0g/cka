what is a name space?
    - allow us to organize resources within
    - virtual cluster inside of a cluster
    - default namespaces
        - kubernetes-dashboard: shipped automatically by minikube
        - kube-system: not meant for human used
        - kube-public: publicly accessible data
            - contains cluster information
        - kube-node-lease: holds information about the heartbeats of nodes (availibility)
        - default
            - used to create resources
    - create a namespaces
        - kubectl create namespacy {my-namespace}
        - better practice is to use a configuraiton file

why to use namespace?
    - complex deoployment will fill default namespace -> no bueno
    - group resources into namespaces -> i.e. db namespace, monitorint namespace, elastic stack, etc.
    - multiple teams
        - avoid conflicts 
        - give team only access to their namespace
    - one cluster with multiple env (i.e. staging and development)
        - not having to deploy twice commonly used services like elsatic stack and nginx controller
    - blue/green deployment
        - two different versions of production
            - blue: active now & green:next version
    - limit resources
        - define resource quota per namespace

characteristics of namespaces?
    - each namespace must define their own config map (can be duplicative)
        - you can't access most resources from other namespaces
    - can share service accross namespaces
    - volume and node cannot be subjected to a namespace, they are global
