- deploy two applications
    - create a mongo db pod
        - need internal service
    - create mongo express deployment
        - we need db url so the mongo db can connect to it
        - we need credentials (username and pw)
        - deployment conig to have env variables
        - need an external service  
    - request flow
        - request comes from broweser -> mongo express external server -> mongo express pod -> mongo db internal service -> mongo db 

- mongo deployment
    - since the mongo deployment uses a secret we first need to create the secret
        - go into dir with secret config
            - kubectl apply -f mongo-secret.yaml
    - start the deployment
        - kubectl apply -f mongo.yaml
    - we need to create a service
        - services usually go in with the deployment configuration file 
            - at the end of the deployment config file ad seperator "---"
-mongo express
    -need to create deployment, service, and external configmap
