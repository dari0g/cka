config files
	-  has 3 parts
		1. metadata - name of component
		2. specification - put config
			- attributes apre sepcific for the "kind"
		3. status - auto generated and edited by k8s
			- continusly gets updated from etcd
	- good practice to store config files with your code (IaaC)
	- templates
		- within specification there is a section called templpate which is a config file within the config file for the pod
	- the way the connection is established is using labels and selectors
	- in the slectors we have a section called matchLabels
		- here we put `app:nginx`
		- everywhere there is key/val pair named app:nginx they will now be able to communicate
		- serive has a ports where it is accessable at
			- db service > port 80 > nginx Service > port 8080 > pod
