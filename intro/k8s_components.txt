k8s components
	- pod
		- smallest unit
		- abstraction over a container (running environment or layer over container)
		- usually 1 application per pod (1 pod for app, 1 pod for db)
		- each pod has it's own IP (internal) address 
		- ephemeral (can die very easily).  When a pod gets replaced the new pod will have a new IP address
	- service
		- how pods communicate with each other
		- permanent IP addresses (does not change when pod dies)
		- each pod has its own service
		- there a three service types
			- external service - accessable through a web browser
				- used for testing
			- interal service - not accessable through a web broser
				- data base
				- does not accept external request
			- ingress
				- production version of exteral service 
	- configmap
		- exteral configuration of your application
		- contians information such as url of databases
	- secret
		- like config map but used to store secret data like passwords
		- stored in base64
	- data storage
		- volumes -  attaches a physical storge on a hard drive to your pod
			- can be on your local machine
			- can be stored remotley (outside of the cluster)
		** Note k8s doesn't manage data persistance **
		- deployment - are used for app pods
		- stateful set - are used to create db pods.
			- takes care of replicating the pods and scaling up & down
			- very hard to do.  DBs are often hosted outside of K8s cluster
